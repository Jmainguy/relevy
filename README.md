Gather information about host, by slurping /etc/relevy/info.yaml, and optionally a remote jsonstats server.

Place this information inside a mongodb host, as configured in /etc/relevy/config.yaml.

This information can then be used by various front ends, such as https://github.com/Jmainguy/relevy-web
